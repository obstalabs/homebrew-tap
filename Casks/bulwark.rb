# Optional pkg-based install channel for the bulwark CLI:
#   brew install --cask obstalabs/tap/bulwark
#
# This installs the signed + notarized + stapled .pkg (offline-trusted), which
# places bulwark in /usr/local/bin. Most users should prefer the FORMULA
# (`brew install obstalabs/tap/bulwark`) — it installs into the Homebrew prefix
# the Homebrew-native way. This cask exists for those who want the installer
# package / offline-stapled artifact.
#
# The macOS Endpoint Security gate bundle is distributed separately; run
# `bulwark doctor` for setup.

  caveats <<~EOS
    macOS kernel enforcement additionally requires the signed Endpoint Security
    gate bundle (distributed separately). After installing it, point the CLI at it:
      export BULWARK_MACOS_ES_GATE=/path/to/bulwark_es_gate.app/Contents/MacOS/bulwark_es_gate
    Then check setup with: bulwark doctor
